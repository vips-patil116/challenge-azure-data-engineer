## Overview

You are a data engineer joining a retail analytics team at Blue Owls Solutions. A partner company has exposed their e-commerce data through a set of internal APIs. Your job is to build a data pipeline that ingests this data, transforms it through a medallion architecture, and produces a star schema for analytics.

The underlying data is based on the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce dataset and is served through our data API. The API is intentionally imperfect — it simulates real-world conditions including intermittent failures, authentication challenges, and occasional data quality issues.

We are not looking for perfection. We are looking for someone who builds resilient systems, thinks clearly about data, and can articulate their decisions. A pipeline that handles failures gracefully and is clearly reasoned is worth more to us than one that is technically complete but brittle or opaque.

---

## Data Access

The data is available through the Blue Owls Data API at `{base_url}/api/v1/data`.

**Authentication:** All requests require a Bearer token. Obtain one by calling the `/api/v1/auth/token` endpoint with the credentials provided in your welcome email.

### Available Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/data/orders`
- `GET /api/v1/data/order_items`
- `GET /api/v1/data/customers`
- `GET /api/v1/data/products`
- `GET /api/v1/data/sellers`
- `GET /api/v1/data/payments`

Each endpoint supports pagination via `?page=1&page_size=1000`. Responses are returned as JSON arrays.

The `orders` and `order_items` endpoints also support date filtering via `?date_from=YYYY-MM-DD&date_to=YYYY-MM-DD`.

> **📅 Data scope:** Ingest records from **2018-07-01 onward** across all endpoints. Use the `date_from` parameter where supported, and apply the same cutoff when filtering related tables (e.g. payments, customers) by joining on order date.

> **⚠️ Important:** The API is intentionally imperfect. It may return intermittent 500 errors, token expiration responses (401), rate limiting (429), and occasional malformed or incomplete records in the payload. Your pipeline should handle these gracefully.

---

## Part 1 — Data Ingestion & Resilience (Weight: 30%)

Build an ingestion layer in Python that pulls data from all API endpoints. Your solution should:

- Handle authentication and automatic token refresh on 401 responses
- Implement retry logic with backoff for 500 and 429 errors
- Validate response payloads and log or quarantine malformed records
- Support paginated extraction across all endpoints
- Be idempotent — running it twice should not produce duplicate data

Save the raw ingested data as your Bronze layer (CSV files in a `bronze/` folder). Add an `_ingested_at` timestamp column and `_source_endpoint` column to each file.

**Data management strategy:** Bronze is append-only — each pipeline run appends new records without overwriting existing data. To prevent duplicates across runs, track which pages or date ranges have already been successfully ingested (e.g. via a simple manifest file or by checking existing records before writing). Re-running the pipeline for the same date range should produce no new rows in Bronze.

---

## Part 2 — Prescribed Star Schema (Weight: 10%)

Implement the following star schema as your Gold layer. The model is fully defined below — your job is to build it correctly through your transformation pipeline.

### Fact Table: `fact_order_items`

**Grain:** one row per item sold in an order

| Column | Type | Source / Logic |
|---|---|---|
| order_item_sk | integer | Surrogate key |
| order_id | string | orders |
| order_item_id | integer | order_items |
| customer_key | integer | FK → dim_customers |
| product_key | integer | FK → dim_products |
| seller_key | integer | FK → dim_sellers |
| order_date | date | orders (purchase_timestamp) |
| order_status | string | orders |
| price | decimal | order_items |
| freight_value | decimal | order_items |
| payment_value | decimal | Total payment for the order (from payments), distributed across items proportionally by item `price`. If an order has 3 items priced at $10, $20, $70, they receive 10%, 20%, 70% of the order's total payment_value respectively. |
| payment_type | string | payments — use the payment type with the highest `payment_value` for the order; if tied, take the first alphabetically |
| payment_installments | integer | payments — use the maximum installment count across payment rows for the order |
| days_to_deliver | integer | Calculated: delivered_customer_date − purchase_timestamp. Null if order not yet delivered. |
| days_delivery_vs_estimate | integer | Calculated: delivered_customer_date − estimated_delivery_date. Positive = late, negative = early. Null if not delivered. |
| is_late_delivery | boolean | True if days_delivery_vs_estimate > 0. Null if not delivered. |

### Dimension: `dim_customers`

**Grain:** one row per unique customer (deduplicated on customer_unique_id)

| Column | Type | Source / Logic |
|---|---|---|
| customer_key | integer | Surrogate key |
| customer_unique_id | string | customers (deduplicate on this, not customer_id) |
| customer_city | string | customers — use the city from the customer's most recent order by purchase_timestamp |
| customer_state | string | customers — use the state from the customer's most recent order |
| customer_zip_code_prefix | string | customers — use from most recent order |
| first_order_date | date | Earliest purchase_timestamp across all orders for this customer |
| total_orders | integer | Count of distinct order_ids |
| total_spend | decimal | Sum of price + freight_value from order_items, across all orders |
| is_repeat_customer | boolean | True if total_orders > 1 |

### Dimension: `dim_products`

**Grain:** one row per product

| Column | Type | Source / Logic |
|---|---|---|
| product_key | integer | Surrogate key |
| product_id | string | products |
| product_category_name | string | products — use "unknown" for null values |
| product_weight_g | decimal | products |
| product_volume_cm3 | decimal | Calculated: product_length_cm × product_height_cm × product_width_cm. Null if any dimension is missing. |
| product_photos_qty | integer | products |
| product_description_length | integer | products |

### Dimension: `dim_sellers`

**Grain:** one row per seller

| Column | Type | Source / Logic |
|---|---|---|
| seller_key | integer | Surrogate key |
| seller_id | string | sellers |
| seller_city | string | sellers |
| seller_state | string | sellers |
| seller_zip_code_prefix | string | sellers |

## Part 3 — PySpark Transformation Pipeline (Weight: 30%)

Implement the star schema above through a medallion architecture. Output each layer as CSVs in folders:

```
output/
├── bronze/       # Raw ingested data, one CSV per API endpoint
├── silver/       # Cleaned & typed data, one CSV per source table
└── gold/         # Star schema tables as defined in Part 2
```

### Bronze Layer

Save the raw API responses as-is, one CSV per endpoint. Add `_ingested_at` and `_source_endpoint` metadata columns.

### Silver Layer

Clean and standardize each source table individually:

- Handle nulls (document your strategy per field)
- Cast columns to correct types (dates as dates, decimals as decimals)
- Remove exact duplicate rows
- Flag records with data quality issues in a boolean `_is_valid` column. Examples of invalid records: orders where `delivered_customer_date` is before `purchase_timestamp`, negative prices, order items with no matching order_id.

**Data management strategy:** Silver reflects the current state of each record. Implement upsert logic using the natural key of each table (e.g. `order_id` for orders, `product_id` for products) so that re-processing updates existing records rather than creating duplicates. Bronze's append-only approach feeds into Silver's deduplicated current-state view.

### Gold Layer

Build the four tables exactly as specified in Part 2. Requirements:

- All surrogate keys should be deterministic and reproducible across runs (e.g. using a hash of the natural key rather than a sequential row number)
- All foreign key relationships should be valid — no orphan keys in the fact table
- Include a brief validation step in your code that prints record counts per table and confirms that all `customer_key`, `product_key`, and `seller_key` values in `fact_order_items` exist in their respective dimension tables

## Part 4 — SQL Analysis (Weight: 15%)

Write SQL queries against your Gold layer tables. These should be compatible with Spark SQL or T-SQL. For each query, include a brief comment explaining your approach.

### Query 1 — Revenue Trend Analysis with Ranking (Required)

For each product category, calculate monthly revenue (price + freight_value) and rank categories within each month by revenue. Then for the top 5 categories by overall revenue, show their month-over-month revenue growth percentage and a 3-month rolling average of revenue. Only include months where the category had at least 10 transactions.

**Expected output columns:** `product_category_name, year, month, monthly_revenue, monthly_rank, mom_growth_pct, rolling_3m_avg_revenue`

### Query 2 — Seller Performance Scorecard (Stretch)

Build a seller scorecard that ranks sellers on a composite score. For each seller, calculate: late delivery rate (percentage of orders where `is_late_delivery = true`), average `days_delivery_vs_estimate`, total revenue, and order count. Compute a percentile rank for each metric across all sellers — invert the ranking for `late_delivery_rate` and `avg_days_vs_estimate` so that lower values yield higher percentiles. Only include sellers with at least 20 orders. Compute a `composite_score` as a weighted average: on-time delivery percentile (40%), delivery speed percentile (30%), revenue percentile (30%).

**Expected output columns:** `seller_id, seller_state, total_orders, total_revenue, late_delivery_rate, avg_days_vs_estimate, on_time_pctl, speed_pctl, revenue_pctl, composite_score, overall_rank`

> Query 1 is required. Query 2 is a stretch goal — attempt it if time allows, and don't let it crowd out the pipeline work.

## Part 5 — README & Technical Decisions (Weight: 15%)

Include a brief README (1–2 pages) in your submission covering:

- Your technical decisions and the reasoning behind them
- How you handled API failures and what your retry/resilience strategy is
- Assumptions you made and any trade-offs you weighed
- What you would change or add for a production deployment on Azure or Microsoft Fabric (scheduling, monitoring, CI/CD, security, cost optimisation)

Be specific rather than generic. A concrete explanation of one real decision — and what you considered before making it — is worth more than a list of buzzwords.

---

## Submission Guidelines

1. Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"** at the top of this page
2. Set your new repository to **Public** and give it a name (e.g. `blue-owls-de-assessment`)
3. Do all your work in your repository — commit regularly so we can follow your progress
4. When you are done, submit us the link to your public repository

Additional requirements:

- **Your entire pipeline must be implemented in Jupyter notebooks using PySpark** — see [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for environment setup
- Include a `requirements.txt` for any packages your code depends on beyond what the notebook image provides
- Notebooks should run end-to-end against the provided API without manual intervention
- Do not commit the raw dataset files — your pipeline should pull from the API

---

## Evaluation Criteria

We assess the following, roughly in order of importance:

| Area | What we look for |
|---|---|
| **Resilience & error handling** | Does the pipeline recover from API failures without crashing or producing corrupt data? |
| **Pipeline correctness** | Does the Gold layer match the prescribed schema with valid data and no orphan keys? |
| **PySpark code quality** | Is the code modular, readable, and clearly structured across notebooks? |
| **SQL correctness** | Is Query 1 correct? Does Query 2 demonstrate analytical depth? |
| **Communication** | Does the README explain real decisions with concrete reasoning? |

**What we don't penalise for:** Not using advanced Spark optimisations (broadcasting, partitioning strategies, caching) — unless you choose to and explain why. Leaving Query 2 incomplete if you've explained your approach.

**What we do penalise for:** Unhandled exceptions that crash the pipeline mid-run. Silent data loss (records dropped with no logging or explanation). A README that lists technologies without explaining decisions.

*Good luck — we look forward to reviewing your work.*
